So, you want to carry an entire enterprise-grade operating system in your pocket? You're tired of the neutered, locked-down environments on public or work computers. You want a fault-tolerant environment if your main computer crashed. Or you want your tools, your configs, your entire digital life, available anywhere, anytime, on any machine.  

You don't want a volatile live USB that forgets everything on reboot. You want a full, proper, persistent installation on a USB stick.  

## The Power of Portable OS
- Privacy & Security: Using a public computer at a library, hotel, or cafe? Booting your own OS means no trace of your activity is left behind on the local machine. Your browsing history, passwords, and files live only on your encrypted USB drive.
- For troubleshooting: It can help you recover files from a corrupted system, reset forgotten passwords, or scan a malware-infected computer without risk of reinfection.
- A Consistent Work Environment: Carry your ideal development suite and use it on any computer you find.

## Material List
- 2 USB sticks: one for booting and one for the OS.
- A machine
- OS iso file

The hardware matters. I choose Kingston Data Traveler 64GB as the USB stick with USB 3.x for the portable OS.  

## Operating Steps
Things are quite similar to installing a regular operationg system. The difference is that some unexpected issues may occur due to different environment.  

### Download `iso` File
This indeed means choose your operating systems.  

I have tried Silverblue, but got a GNOME empty shell. This time I tried CentOS Stream 10.  

### Creating the Installer Media
An easy way: Fedora Media Writer  

An universal way: `dd`  

### Insatllation
Power on while hitting F2 or other keys. It depends on the machine.  

Boot with the boot usb and go into the installation program.  

**WARNING:**  
**Pay Attention to Installation Destination! DO NOT CHOOSE THE WRONG DISK!**  

Advices:
1. Enable encryption. Without it, whoever finds it has all your data.
2. Disable kdump. It may cause an installation failure.
3. Auto partition is OK but when some error occurs, you may need partition manually.

After that, drink a cup of coffee and wait patiently. It'll be slower than a normal internal SSD install.  

### Reboot
Success or failture will be determined here.  

## The Verdict: Was It Worth It?
Absolutely. The feeling of plugging a stick into a random computer, interrupting its boot process, unlocking your encrypted drive, and being greeted by your environment is pure digital magic. It's independence. It's power. It's security.
